    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Pinrong Chen</h2>
    <p>My name is Pinrong Chen, but I also go by Cynthia. I am a junior at Staten Island Technical High School. 
        I am the oldest of three, with two younger brothers. Some of my favorite things to do in my free time are 
        watching tv shows and movies, baking, hanging out with friends, shopping, or just browsing and adding more 
        unnecessary things to my wishlist. I am very new to the world of coding and just started to learn. I am interested 
        to discover many new things and be able to use it on my own.    </p>
